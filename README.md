## A documentation for the traffic light project created using Tinkercad

### Description:
This is a Performance Task for creating a useful tool using arduino uno. I chose to create a traffic light project because it is a useful tool that can be used in real life. It is also a good way to practice my coding skills in arduino. I can apply the skills of controlling the other arduino uno board using the I2C communication protocol. The skill of using the input panel is also integrated in this project.

### Features:
When the project boots up. You can set the duration of the green, yellow, and red light. The speaker will also make a sound when switching between signs (green to red or red to green).
